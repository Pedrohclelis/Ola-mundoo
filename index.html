        <h2 id='lore'>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>The <u>Abyss Watchers</u> were the main component of the <strong>Undead Legion of Farron</strong>, a special fighting force formed to combat the threat of the Abyss. Taking inspiration from the Wolf Knight <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Knight_Artorias" rel="external">(Sir Artorias, the Abyss Walker)</a>, the <u>Abyss Watchers</u> themselves sought to utilize the techniques of <em>Artorias</em>, and partook of wolf blood to do so. Now equipped with the strength of Artorias, they became intensely strong and agile, fighting in a coordinated and sporadic pack akin to wolves.</p>

        <p>Though the Legion was not inherently evil or overtly violent, at the slightest threat of the Abyss, the <u>Watchers</u> would go so far as to decimate an entire territory. Their distinct outfits, topped off with a tall pointed helm, became an ill omen for any who saw them. Their wolf-blood fighting style was enhanced by the revolutionary use of <abbr title="Farron Greatsword">an ultra greatsword (<img class='min' src="http://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Dark-Souls-3/farron_greatsword.png" rel="external" alt="">)</abbr> modeled after <abbr title="Greatsword of Artorias"><em>Artorias'</em> sword (<img class='min' src="https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Dark-Souls-3/wolf_knights_greatsword.png" rel="external" alt="">)</abbr> along with a carved dagger, utilizing the dagger as support for them to develop their own unique, highly agile fighting techniques that were even more unpredictable and vicious than their predecessor. As such, they disdained the use of shields and preferred a constant offense.</p>

        <p>Their wolf blood did more than enhance their bodies, but their very essence, for all those who partook in it were <em>linked</em> to the soul of <em>Artorias</em> himself. As such, instead of each body hosting distinct souls, all that partook the wolf blood share the one soul distributed among them.</p>

        <h2>Actually</h2>
        <p>Along with the actual <u>Abyss Watchers</u>, the complete Undead Legion consisted of two other levels. To assist them, the <u>Abyss Watchers</u> recruited acolytes, who provided support via miracles and sorceries.  At some point, they made a pact of uncertain terms with one of the <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_Sage" rel="external">Crystal Sages</a> of the kingdom of <strong>Lothric</strong>, who agreed to come to their headquarters in Farron and train their acolytes in sorcerous arts. </p>

        <p class='subtitle'>Crystal Sage of Lothric, a scholar who fell a long time ago</p>
        <p>Due to the Legion's emphasis of speed over physical power, they asked the skilled sorcerer to develop unique variations of existing sorceries for the acolytes to use. Some of them were made by a scholar named Heysel, the daughter of the head acolyte, and refined even further than that.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most telling of their fall were the number of foot soldiers tasked with the covert disposal of corrupted members, as the Abyss would slowly alter them, so the "Followers" as they were called would be sent to execute them before they were transformed into creatures. Their primary technique was to surround the target, burning and stabbing them, and finishing them with honor by throwing a spear to kill them.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the Watchers <em>linked</em> the Fire, although it is unknown if one or all had done so, but had returned as <strong>Lords of Cinder</strong>.  </p>
        <p>Beneath their home in Farron Keep, is the Catacombs of Carthus, which contain a chalice holding <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/High_Lord_Wolnir" rel="external">High Lord Wolnir</a>, who fell to the Abyss long ago. Along with the cindered Smouldering Lake, nearby is the Cathedral of the Deep, resting place of <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Aldrich,_Devourer_of_Gods" rel="external">Aldrich, Devourer of Gods</a>.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Ending</h2>
        <p>With nothing to live for after the <u>Abyss Watchers</u> <em>linked</em> the flame, the Followers went hollow, roaming the land and eventually disappearing into the <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Painted_World_of_Ariandel">Painted World of Ariandel</a>. Since there were none to execute the corrupt, the acolytes were slowly devolved by the Abyss, and Farron was consumed in a rotting bog. Once the <u>Abyss Watchers</u> had awakened, their home was corrupt and their mission unsuccessful.</p>

        <p>The Watchers in the keep now fight against themselves; endlessly slaying their brethren corrupted by the Abyss, in an endless cycle of heresy and destruction.</p>

        <h2 id='theories'>Why the Watchers Attack Each Other</h2>
        <p>Like <em>Artorias</em>, they was probably taken by the Abyss. Maybe they were all corrupted and killed each other until only one stood. Perhaps they locked themselves away to prevent the spread of the corruption, thinking that it would die there, with them.

            The Watchers may have been caught in an endless cycle of killing each other because they were tainted by the abyss. Since they are undead, they never truly die, so there was always another tainted one rising to be killed again. They all shared one soul, so when one died, it's soul would be absorbed back into the group, resurrect him. When you kill the last Watcher, you instead absorb the soul, breaking the cycle.
            
            One possibility for why the Watchers fell to the Abyss was that they were overtaken by High Lord Wolnir, who fell into the Abyss and took them by surprise, corrupting some of them and turning them on each other. The legion would snuff out a kingdom on the first sign of Exposure. So, they became locked in an endless battle with each other while Farron was consumed by Abyss.
            
            So, they fight each other to rid themselves of the curse. The Wolf Knight Set description suggests the Watchers knew they would eventually be tainted by the Abyss they sought to eradicate.</p>
        <h2>The Watchers and High Lord Wolnir</h2>
        <p>The Catacombs of Carthus come right after the area where you encounter the Abyss Watchers. Carthus was a desert kingdom though, and the Watchers were in a swamp, which doesn't make sense geographically. However, the lands of the Lords of Cinder are colliding, so as the world "folds" geography gets a bit wonky. Furthermore, you don't go through the deserts in Carthus to get to their catacombs, instead you go through the Abyss Watchers' fortress and then into the catacombs beneath Carthus.

            The Abyss Watchers were a force of destruction, but with a specific target: they waged ruthless crusades against kingdoms where the Watchers caught the faintest whiff of the Abyss. High Lord Wolnir fell to the Abyss, and as a consequence, Carthus certainly would have been on the Watchers' radar. Wolnir conquered his neighboring lords and gathered their crowns, becoming the unquestioned High Lord of Carthus. No way the Abyss Watchers would tolerate a kingdom ruled by a being tainted by the Abyss, even if he struggled against it. So, the Abyss Watchers likely set out to destroy Carthus, laying waste to his kingdom. When they reached Wolnir, they did what they could to contain the massively powerful conqueror and sealed him away in the goblet of bone, locked in the catacombs.</p>

            <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hawkwood the Deserter is a former member of the Watchers, and is speculated that he eventually deserted the Legion in part because of the mockery he received for his shield.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>From the description of their soul and the ability to create the Wolf Knight's Greatsword, it seems that the massive soul of the Undead Legion is a reincarnation of Artorias   himself, as many souls have been known to eventually reincarnate.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The design of the Abyss Watchers appears to be based on the Keeper of the Old Lords from Bloodborne.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>It's speculated the Abyss Watchers' souls became one shortly after linking the flame. It's likely the fire could only ever be linked by one person at a time but since the Abyss Watchers themselves were linked by the blood of the wolf, they were able to link the fire at the price of their individuality, their souls becoming one in the process.</li>
